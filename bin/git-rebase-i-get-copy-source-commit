Usage: $(basename "$0")

Gets the default commit that we should copy from, for use in many scripts such as
git-commit-amend-copy-committer.

By default, gets the rebase-local-original commit via git-rebase-i-get-orig-commit.

If GIT_COPY_SOURCE_COMMIT_MAP is optionally set, looks up the very-original commit from that
local-original commit, and returns that instead.

# through a specific commit map to get a very-original commit id.

# If your current branch is already rewritten relative to your very-original branch, then the commit
# reported by git-rebase-i-get-orig-commit (which gets it from the pick line, which has the
# already-rewritten commit id) is _not_ the original commit id from your very-original
# branch. In such a case, if you've messed something up and lost some detail from your very-original
# branch (which you _should_ have preserved as par of your previous rebase, but you didn't), then
# you can run your local-original commit id through your very-original-to-local-original map file to
# look up the very-original commit from that local-original commit.
# With that, you can now copy over some things from the commits in the pre-written (very-original)
