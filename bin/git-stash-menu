# provides quick access to stashes
# saves you from having to do
# git stash list
# git stash show
# to make sure it's the right one
# before applyin or popping
#
# and helps you find and remove no-longer-needed stashes

# I wish you could just show all your stashes in a row like git log -p (but I realize that the stashes are not related/parents of each other)
# then you could search through all your stashes for a keyword -- how do I do that now?

# lets you rename/reword a stash
# (for example, you could note that it's been applied already but you're keeping around for ref)

# when you do a stash save, record the date and HEAD rev
# show this when we do list
# we need the date so we know how old!
