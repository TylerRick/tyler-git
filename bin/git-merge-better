Usage: #{File.basename($0)} [options] [file_with_conflict]

An alternative to git mergetool.

Run this command any time you have a merge conflict -- no matter if you're doing git merge, git rebase, or git cherrypick. It will help you look at the attempted merge from a couple different "angles" to help you as you try to resolve the conflict by hand.

Git mergetool (always, as far as I know) tries to show you the merge as a 3-way diff. But I find the 3-way diff hard to look at, confusing, and distracting. 2-way diffs are so much easier to look at. It is nice to see the 3 versions side by side (2 versions + conflicted) -- it's just the diff highlighting that is annoying/distracting. 
I figured that in many cases it would be much easier and quicker to understand the merge by simply looking at a 2-way diff and then, using that (and a list of diffs/commits from each branch being merged) as reference, to resolve the conflict sections in an editor window that *isn't* diffed with anything (or perhaps is diffed against [one of the files produced for the 2-way diff]).

To create the 2-way diffs, you have 2 options:

  'from_conflicted' -- This starts from the partially-merged file with the conflict markers file, strips out conflict versions, saves these as temporary files
                       (mine.from_conflicted and upstream.from_conflicted) and shows you these partially-merged versions side by side

  'actual'          -- This shows the version exactly it existed in their branch and in your branch (using git show).

    Usually, this diff is messier than 'from_conflicted' because it hasn't attempted to merge anything yet.
    So I usually prefer looking primarily at from_conflicted diffs, and only consulting these versions (not necessarily their diff, which is often pretty useless) if I want to double-check how a portion of the file appeared in 'their' version, for example.
    Also, when I see how few differences there are between the from_conflicted versions, and can't believe that that's all that was different, it's sometimes nice to be able to do a sanity check and see the *actual* differences (pre-merge-attempt) between the two versions.

    TODO: how do these versions differ from the LOCAL and REMOTE from git mergetool -t vimdiff?

Because these are saved as temporary files, you feel free to edit them however is useful. For example, if in mine.from_conflicted, you see that a block was indented and surrounded with an if statement, perhaps you might unindent that block, just so the diff highlighting will stop showing it as a difference (since the only difference for those lines is the indenting).
Modifying these temporary files doesn't affect your main [conflicted] file, so you can feel free to make whatever edits you want to them, since they will be thrown away anyway.

If you get tired of looking at the merge from one "angle", you can always switch to a different angle.

Other views included:
* A log of which changes were made to the upstream branch and to your branch
  * Example use:
    * After merging from_conflicted.mine into file_with_conflict, you may want to scan through upstream.log.diff and mine.log.diff to make sure none of the important changes represented in those logs got accidentally dropped while doing your manual merge.  
    * Or you could start with mine.actual and manually apply all the changes represented in upstream.log.diff.
    * Or you could start with upstream.actual and manually apply all the changes represented in mine.log.diff.
  * For each commit and file in each commit, it adds a command line that you can run to get a side-by-side diff (I set up my Vim so I can press F5 on a line to execute the command on that line)
* ...

If file_with_conflict is omitted, it will loop through all unmerged files using git each-unmerged (which in turn will call git-merge-better on each unmerged file)

It's amazing how needlessly useless file_with_conflict is when the conflict involves lines that differ only (or mostly) in the leading whitespace on those lines. So if you do anything that requires indenting a block of code (such as wrapping it in an if statement), prepare for a merge conflict that is annoying to resolve even though the difference is so minor.
You can specify -b, --ignore-space-change
  Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent.
when doing normal, 2-way diffs, but there is no option that I can find to get git merge to ignore changes in whitespace.
See for example:
  [1] http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Merge-rebase-and-whitespace-fixes-td3176489.html
  [2] http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/git-merge-ignoring-whitespace-td2278058.html
One or the other of the whitespace variations from the two branches would have to win eventually, and which one is better probably can't be determined programmatically, but in my opinion, it would be better to let it just choose one arbitrarily than raising a false alarm about a conflict when there really is none (or at least where the only conflict is the whitespace differences).

Another solution is to "try to "normalize" the whitespace, and perform the merge after that." [2] and [1]:
  One thing I have done in the past when trying to merge two diverged 
  trees was to format each commit in each tree to a common standard. 

  One of the ways in which the trees had diverged was whitespace 
  (non-meaningful) changes, so I used the Eclipse formatter as part of a 
  "git filter-branch" script to make sure that I was ony looking at 
  meaningful changes between the trees at each point. This significantly 
  simplified the process. 
Which is great if you both know how and have the foresight to do so prior to your merge/rebase, but what about those of us who only discover this after they have started the rebase/merge and have invested hours getting to the point they are at in the conflict resolution process? If only one could easily and reliable save all the resolutions you've resolved so far, then go back to the original branches, consistentify them, and then somehow resume where you left off in the merge/rebase...

Another solution would be to just have it format file_with_conflict in a saner way, or providing additional information/views to help you to see the substantive changes easier. But I guess that's where this script comes in...

So the best solution I have at the moment is to use vimdiff to compare the from_conflicted files, making sure set diffopt+=iwhite so that it doesn't highlight whitespace changes.
Then you can see clearly enough whether or not there are any *real* changes and ensure that those make it into your resolved version.
In many cases I find it's easier to just resolve the substantive changes first and then just fix the whitespace as you're doing that -- instead of dealing with the conflict markers in file_with_conflict at all. In other words, the whitespace fixes will come naturally as you apply the real changes -- don't let the sometimes large-looking supposed "conflicts" scare or confuse you.
