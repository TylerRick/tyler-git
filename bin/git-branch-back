(In case you haven't been using git push/pop)

Parses git reflog.

so if you it is this:

a8b0581 2016-07-12 09:49:17 -0700 - checkout: moving from master to 2016-2017
a042c06 2016-07-12 17:58:57 +0000 - checkout: moving from 210_attendance_fields to master
56a4ade 2016-07-11 20:39:04 -0700 - checkout: moving from master to 210_attendance_fields

that means you should have 2016-2017 checked out currently (assertion error if not?)
so branch-back would take you to master

Then we'd probably have this:
checkout: moving from 2016-2017 to master
checkout: moving from master to 2016-2017
checkout: moving from 210_attendance_fields to master
checkout: moving from master to 210_attendance_fields

should branch-back go back to 2016-2017 (like cd -) or back to 210_attendance_fields (find the one *before* the mirror image "master <- 2016-2017 -> master")?
