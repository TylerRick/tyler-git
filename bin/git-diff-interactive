# git-add -i/-p are of limited usefulness because they only let you choose which hunks to *stage*; they don't give you the option to delete a hunk, for example.
# This command aims to provide that missing functionality. For each modified file, you can open it in your editor (vimdiff) and actually *delete* or edit a hunk
# before staging it.
# By default, it assumes when you are finished editing a hunk, that you are ready to stage it, and so it will auto-stage them as soon as you return from the editor;
# but you can use the (w)ithout staging action to turn off auto-staging for a particular edit.

# To do:
# * let you specify (config or command line) whether to do just a diff (then it won't keep showing you diffs of what you've already staged)
#   or to also do a diff --cached (in case you've already staged stuff but now aren't so sure about it and want to amend/edit the hunks that
#   have already been staged)
#   * in the latter case, cat the output from both, save to a temp file, and then run that file through a pager
# * add a config-file option for auto-staging
