# Lists all commits (log) but also shows refs/notes/specificity

# TODO: add this as alternative to git-ls-notes-specificity
# uses git log / rev-list instead, so that we also see
# which commits are _missing_ a specificity

# For now we have this alias:
#   log-oneline-notes         = log --color --pretty=format:'%Cred%h %Cgreen%ai %Cblue%an%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %C(magenta)%N'
# but it adds an extra newline between lines.
