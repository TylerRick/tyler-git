# this command can't be reversed with git-stash apply, unfortunately 
# (what used to be untracked files will now be staged files), 
# so that kind of limits its usefulness
# To do: fix that

# Save:

# do a 2-step stash save, to keep the untracked ones in a separate stash
#git-stash "$@"
git-add `git-ls-files-by-status -U -1`
git-stash "$@"


# Load:
#git-stash pop
# untrack everything added by this stash
#git-stash pop
