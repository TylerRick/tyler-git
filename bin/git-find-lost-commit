# When you think you added or made a change to a certain file, but can't find the commit that
# contains it (maybe it's in a stash, a tag, a branch?), you can search your gitlog for evidence of that commit.

# TODO: Make it generalized, so you can pass:
# - what to search: reflog, stash, or both
# - a file name (or dir name? or multiple files?) to search for the changes in; or none to just
#   search the entire patch
# - if searching a file, do you want to search the file contents (git cat) or only the patch/diff (git log -U0
#   -p -1) (maybe only the latter should be allowed)
# - a regex pattern, which if matched means we found a candidate
#   or if a single regex isn't powerful enough (like you need to check if this matches this but not
#   this), provide a script that checks if it is a match
# - what to show/do if a candidate is found: just print the ref, just print the short log line, show
#   the actual patch, ...?

  # actually don't want the leading +/- because the search regex might match that by mistake (one
  # argument for using git show on file instead of git log -p / git show on commit ref)
