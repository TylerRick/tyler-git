# switches to the master branch (or whichever one you specify), does a git pull, (assumes the merge will be successful because you are doing all your changes in a topic branch and *not* in master),
# and then switches back to the topic branch you were on
# useful if you want to do a rebase: issue this command first to make sure the 'master' branch you are rebasing against is actually up-to-date!

# alternatively, do a git fetch and then rebase against FETCH_HEAD
# git rebase FETCH_HEAD master
