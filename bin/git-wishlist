# I wish I could have the same interactive functionality provided by git rebase -i to squash/reorder commits even when not doing a rebase...
#
# git-filter-branch looks it might be able to do some of those things but it's way too hard to use and not interactive.


# it's kind of annoying that you have to commit any modifications so that your working tree is not dirty before you do certain operations
# fortunately, it's easy to create a new branch (co -b) for whatever you aren't ready to commit and to commit it in the new branch as a WIP and then switch back...
# but you hope that you don't forget about your WIP or accidentally merge/push it!
# wrap git so that it will warn you if you switch to a branch that has any WIP
# also, prevent you from merging any branches that have WIP commits


# untracked files seem like they should stay with a certain branch and not follow
# you around whenever you switch branches
