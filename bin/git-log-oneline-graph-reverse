# Normally you cannot combine --graph and --reverse for git log.
# This is a workaround for that limitation.

# Examples:
#   # Add a horizontal line after each "Merge" commit to make it easier to spot them.
#   git-log-oneline-graph-reverse $rev | git-log-highlight-merges-after | less


{ git log-oneline-graph "$@" | git-graph-tac; } \
  | ( [ -t 1 ] && exec less -R || cat )
