# Normally you cannot combine --graph and --reverse for git log.
# This is a workaround for that limitation.
# It simply takes the normal "forward" log and then reverses the lines, and changes the direction of
# the arrows.

# Examples:
#   # Add a horizontal line after each "Merge" commit to make it easier to spot them.
#   git-log-oneline-graph-reverse $rev | git-log-highlight-merges-after | less


{
  {
    git log-oneline-graph "$@"
    echo # Otherwise there's no trailing in our input stream.
  } \
      | git-graph-tac;
} \
  | ( [ -t 1 ] && exec less -R || cat )
  # Apply pager if stdin connected to terminal
