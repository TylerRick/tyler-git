# TODO: add option to prompt user if the commit looks good before starting the grbi
# it would just do a glp -1 and if they want to continue or abort
# usefel because sometimes you've staged only parts (chunks) and then you want to make sure it
# includes only those commits even though you're passing a filename to git-commit-fixup-rebase (git
# commit would commit only the passed paths).
# I suppose that's what
#   git diff --find-renames --find-copies --staged
# is for, but this would help you be absolutely sure that your commit contains what you think it
# contains before you squash into another commit and make it impossible to separate out again and
# see what you're changing now.
# is it more like rm --interactive or --verbose?

# TODO!!: If your current branch is based on (includes them as ancestors) another branch (such as
# master), offer to also rebase that branch(es) at the same time, so that this branch *continues* to
# be based on that branch, without diverging (and without having to manually rebase both).
# Technically, there is no need to *actually* use the rebase operation on both. Just rebase this
# current branch (which has more commits than the base branch), and then simply use update-ref to
# update the ancestor branch(es) to the respective new rewritten commit that corresponds to the
# previous tip of those branch(es).

# TODO: Warn if any rebase would cause it to diverge from upstream (that is, warn if you rewrite any
# history/commits prior to the tip of the branch's upstream)

# TODO: Add --squash option like git-commit has (also --fixup to be complete?)

# doesn't skip this modification if no change is needed (if the commit date and author date already
# match.)
# As a workaround to deal with an each-time-changing base commit id, you can just keep searching for
