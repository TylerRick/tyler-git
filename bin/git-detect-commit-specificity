Usage: $(basename "$0") [options] [<commit>]

Tries to detect/classify the specificity of the given commit based on the specificity of the files
contained in its tree.  It then records this specificity (unless --no-record).

Options:
  --if-needed, --trust-recorded
    If we've already recorded the specificity for this commit, then we trust that it is correct and
    can skip doing the usual recording step. Equivalent to passing --no-record in that case.
    We still run the file detection, though, in case we had any unknown" files in this commit; we
    don't want to leave those unclassified!

    Since the automatic detection is prone to false positives and negatives, this option is
    recommended if ever you're running this again for a commit where you know you've already
    classified it correctly.

  --no-file-detect
    Skip running git-diff-tree-specificity --detect at the beginning. This could be useful if you're
    sure you've already correctly detected the specificity of the files contained in this commit's
    tree.

  --no-record, -n
    Enables a read-only mode, where it will report the specificity that it inferred for this commit
    but not record it.

  --force, -f
    Without this, it will refuse to update recorded specificity to the specificity it
    detected/inferred based on file detection _if_ the new classification is mixed and we've
    previously recorded that it is common or specific. Instead it will warn something like this:

      => Would have set to mixed but was already set to specific. Skipping.

  --ensure-present
    Exit with failure if no specificity recorded yet.
End
  exit
