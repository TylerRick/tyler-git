# I was able to do git-log <sha> for a commit that a saw a notification for
# but it wasn't listed in the log for master and I wanted to know which
# branch it WAS in (if not master)....

# (turned out it was in origin/test, for which I had no tracking local branch,
# so gitk wouldn't even let me jump to it)

# this tool should take a sha, and perhaps recursively look at the commit's parents
# until it reaches a head

# .git/refs/remotes/origin/test

# actually, I ran into it in .git/FETCH_HEAD
