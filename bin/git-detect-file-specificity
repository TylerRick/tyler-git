# Usage: git-detect-file-specificity [<commit>] <file>
# Detects if a file is specific via git-detect-file-is-specific.
#
# Unlike git-get-file-specificity, which _only_ reads what has previously been recorded, this
# actually tries to do some detection, and checks whether what has been recorded matches.
