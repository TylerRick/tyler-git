# Normally you cannot combine --graph and --reverse for git log.
# This is a workaround for that limitation.
# Example:
#   git log-oneline-graph master | git-graph-tac | less
# (git-log-oneline-graph-reverse encapsulates this into a single simple command)
#
# Given in input stream from git log --graph with a one-line format,
# this reverses the order of the commits
# and swaps the / and \ characters so that they are going the right direction for the graph to make sense with the reversed commits.

sed -e 's@/@\x01@g' -e 's@\\@/@g' -e 's@\x01@\\@g' | tac
